            <h3>Coupled Human-Infrastructure Systems</h3>
            <p>Coupled human-infrastructure systems capture the intricate interdependencies between communities 
              and the infrastructure they rely on. These systems are shaped by how individuals and communities 
              use infrastructure, depend on it, and experience its failures—especially during times of 
              disruption. Disasters often expose disparities in resilience, as households—such as 
              those with limited mobility, economic resources, or access to services—face heightened risks 
              due to their constrained ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from events.
              <br>
              <br>
              My research focuses on developing modeling frameworks that simulate these interdependencies to 
              better understand the dynamics of socio-technical systems. Using system dynamics and complex 
              network-based approaches, we explore both infrastructure-to-human and human-to-infrastructure 
              feedback during disasters. This integration enables us to analyze how human behavior affects 
              infrastructure performance and vice versa, ultimately offering insights into how targeted 
              interventions can enhance community resilience.

          <h3>Critical Facility Accessibility and Road Criticality</h3>
          <p>Critical facility accessibility is essential for disaster response and recovery, yet road 
            networks often provide uneven access across communities. Disruptions such as flooding can 
            isolate populations from essential services or significantly increase travel times, 
            disproportionately affecting communities at risk. This research adopts an integrated 
            network-based approach to evaluate accessibility by accounting for partial road failures, 
            multiple types of critical facilities, and changes in travel time during flood events.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some roads play a disproportionately important role in maintaining access to these critical 
            facilities. To increase disaster resilience, my work involves identifying the most critical 
            roads for protection and early recovery. While certain segments are frequently used in 
            post-flood travel routes, others are vital for preserving access to avoid formation of 
            service deserts. My research combines complex network-based approaches with optimization 
            techniques on large-scale networks to identify and prioritize essential roads for 
            protection and early recovery.

            <h3>Household Adaptation and Predictive Modeling</h3>
            <p>Households depend on infrastructure systems for essential services, and during disruptions, 
              they often adapt by adjusting their demand or supplementing supply to lessen the impact. 
              These adaptations—whether planned or spontaneous—play a critical role in maintaining 
              household functioning and resilience, serving as a bridge between infrastructure performance 
              and community well-being during crises. Understanding these behaviors is vital for supporting 
              equitable and effective disaster response.
              <br>
              <br>
              This research aims to characterize and predict household adaptations during infrastructure 
              service interruptions using econometric models and machine learning techniques. By capturing 
              how and when households implement various adaptations, the study provides insights for 
              system operators, emergency managers, and community organizations to better incorporate 
              adaptive behaviors into planning, restoration efforts, and resource allocation.
